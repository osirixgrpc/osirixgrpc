__Welcome__ to the OsiriXgrpc documentation. Here you will find setup routines required to run OsiriXgrpc 
from within OsiriX and how it can be used to create OsiriX plugins at speed.

This plugin will typically be used alongside a supporting tool, which currently is exclusively pyosirix (pyosirix.com); 
this provides simplest OsiriX functionality through a convenient Python interface.
