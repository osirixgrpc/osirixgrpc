# OsiriXgrpc	

_NOTE_: This repository is still in development. Bare with us, it will be released soon!

__Welcome__ to the OsiriXgrpc documentation. Here you will find some of the setup routines required to run OsiriXgrpc 
from within OsiriX and how it can be used to create OsiriX plugins at speed.

Note that typically this plugin is not used in isolation and will be used alongside a supporting tool.  Currently,
this is exclusively pyosirix (pyosirix.com), which provides OsiriX functionality through a convenient Python interface.
