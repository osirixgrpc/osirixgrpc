# Basics

> ___Note___: This is the long-winded way to do things. We _strongly_ encourage using the [pyosirix](404.html) library
  for day-to-day development. 
 
GRPC supports many [languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/), including C++, Java, Go, Node.js, and PHP. 
We currently only support use of Python because the libraries available image processing and machine-learning,
and it comes with a relatively short learning curve. All examples are therefore shown in Python, but if you are 
interested in generating the GRPC code for other client languages, then please see the 
[contributing](../contributing/README.md) section and enclosed pages.
